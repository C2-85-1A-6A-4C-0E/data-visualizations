# IPUMS-CPS VEP turnout weight correction

The R script reads microdata from IPUMS-CPS and implements the corrected weights described at http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/cps-methodology. This allows for generation of turnout estimates from CPS microdata that are consistent with the VEP turnout rates at http://www.electproject.org. 

Note: VESUPPWT is identical to WTFINL in IPUMS-CPS data
