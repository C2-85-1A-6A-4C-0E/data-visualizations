electoral_college.R reads data and compiles into summary files for charts and stats in the blog post. Two of the major data sources are not included here due to size:

* CVAP population estimates available here: https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2016/dec/rdo/2012-2016-CVAP.html
* Census tract shapefile for calculating household density, available here: http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2010DP1/
